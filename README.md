# examples for lecture on React.js

These examples us a CDN-hosted version of react libraries, together with the Babel transpiler so we can use JSX.

This is not how React is used in production, it is only for quick experimentation and demonstration.

## Examples

* `1-hello-message.html` – a simple component
* `2-greeter-with-input.html` – a component with HTML input and state
* `3-counter.html` – a component with state and a button
* `4-timer.html` – a timer done with effects and state
